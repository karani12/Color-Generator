# Color-Generator

I wrote this script that generates colors using HSL values
 ## The main aim:
 - To use rules that help in creating color schemes.
 - Convert rules to an algorithm that generates the color.
 
 The script is written in Javascript and accepts hex values which is the default browser option. The hexadecimal value is broken down using regex and converted to RGB then HSL.
 I modified the hue, sarturation and luminosity values to produce the generator.
## Caution
The project doesn't store the values but only generates them and allows you to copy paste. Make sure you copy paste.

## How to use

- Input the color you want colors that go well with it generated
- Click on either of the four buttons depending on which method you want colors generated
- Copy paste the HSL values
